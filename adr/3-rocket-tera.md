# ADR for Backend Development with Rust, Rocket, and Tera

## Title

Implementing Backend with Rust, Rocket Framework, and Tera Templating

## Status

Proposed

## Context

In seeking a robust, efficient, and secure approach for our backend development, we are considering the Rust programming language, along with the Rocket web framework and Tera templating engine. This decision arises from the need for high performance, memory safety, and scalable web service architecture. Rust's growing ecosystem and Rocket's ease of use for web applications make this combination appealing.

## Decision

We propose to develop our backend using Rust with the Rocket framework and Tera for templating. Rust offers memory safety and high performance, which is crucial for our data-intensive and high-traffic application. Rocket, a web framework for Rust, provides a simple and intuitive API, routing capabilities, and native support for request and response handling. Tera will be used for rendering HTML, leveraging its template inheritance and powerful expression language, which will enhance our ability to deliver dynamic content.

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
1. Enhanced performance and efficiency due to Rust's low-level control and optimization capabilities.
2. Improved memory safety and reduced risk of common security vulnerabilities, thanks to Rust's ownership model.
3. Streamlined web development process with Rocket's intuitive API and feature-rich framework.
4. Flexible and maintainable frontend rendering with Tera's templating system.

**Negative Consequences:**
1. Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Rust and its paradigms.
2. Limited pool of existing libraries and third-party integrations compared to more mature backend languages like Python or JavaScript.
3. Increased initial development time due to the complexities of Rust and the need for more detailed planning around memory management and concurrency.
4. Potentially longer build times inherent with Rust's compilation process.

By adopting Rust, Rocket, and Tera, we aim to build a robust, efficient, and secure backend, while being prepared for the associated learning curve and initial development overhead.
