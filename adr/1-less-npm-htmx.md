# ADR for Using Frontend with LESS, HTMX, and NPM

## Title

Adopting LESS, HTMX, and NPM for Frontend Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our current frontend development process faces challenges in terms of maintainability, scalability, and efficiency. We have identified the need for more sophisticated tools to manage CSS, enhance HTML interactivity, and handle package management effectively. This decision record evaluates the adoption of LESS for CSS preprocessing, HTMX for enhancing HTML capabilities, and NPM for package management.

## Decision

We propose to integrate LESS, HTMX, and NPM into our frontend development workflow. LESS will be used for writing more manageable and scalable CSS, leveraging its features like variables, nesting, and mixins. HTMX will be introduced to enhance the interactivity of our web pages, allowing us to implement dynamic content updates without the complexity of a full JavaScript framework. NPM will be used as our package manager to efficiently manage and update our frontend dependencies.

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
1. Enhanced CSS maintainability and scalability through LESS, reducing the complexity of our stylesheets.
2. Improved user experience with dynamic content loading using HTMX, without a significant increase in frontend complexity.
3. Streamlined management of frontend dependencies with NPM, ensuring consistent and up-to-date packages across development environments.

**Negative Consequences:**
1. Learning curve for the team to adapt to LESS and HTMX.
2. Potential increase in build and deployment time due to the addition of preprocessing steps for LESS.
3. Need to ensure compatibility of HTMX with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

By adopting these tools, we aim to improve the efficiency and quality of our frontend development process, while being mindful of the challenges and adjustments required for a smooth transition.
